# Inventory-Management-System
Inventory Management System using Spring Boot.
In this system we have 2 types of authorization: ADMIN and SUPERVISOR where both have access to login and register, SUPERVISOR can see the products and send 
stock requests and the ADMIN manages everything else along with managing the SUPERVISORS themselves.
